# Steps to get started

To get started and contributed, this is a fastapi backend and we use uv as
a python package and venv manager.

First make sure you have uv installed for more info check this link:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/. If you have brew it's just
`brew install uv`.

1. make sure venv is activated, venv folder is already in .venv/, if on mac `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. `uv pip install` - downloads deps
3. `uv run fastapi dev` - run app in dev
