Normalize each company’s raw metric x to a 0–100 scale: If x ≤ P₅, then norm = 0, If x ≥ P₉₅, then norm = 100.
In all other cases, norm = (x – P₅) / (P₉₅ – P₅) × 100  
Compute three category scores (each 0–100) by averaging the normalized scores in each category, then rounding to the nearest integer:
